# Public Slides

This repository contains slides of courses I teach. They are written in Markdown and rendered with [Marp](https://marp.app/). You can either directly look at the Markdown files rendered on Github or at the slides deployed to Github pages by going to https://davidstraub.de/public-slides.

See the [blog post](https://davidstraub.de/posts/my-new-presentation-slide-setup/) for details about my presentation slide setup.
